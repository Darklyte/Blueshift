# Mass Effect: Blueshift
Information for the Mass Effect: Blueshift tabletop roleplaying game created by Michael McElrath

## What is Blueshift?

*Thirty years ago, our galaxy was attacked by a race of sentient starships known as the reapers. The reapers, while vastly incomprehensible, had a simple goal: the harvest of the galaxyâ€™s organic life. They have returned every 50,000 years in an extinction cycle that has existed for eons. During the most recent cycle we were fortunate enough to discover their plan before it could be fully executed. We fought back for years and with the unified effort of the galactic denizens, we were the first cycle able to force the reapers to retreat. The fight is not over, but we are at a distinct advantage.*

Join the playtest of a new tabletop RPG based in the Mass Effect universe. Taking place 30 years after the Reaper War, galactic civilization is still rebuilding itself. As a tabletop roleplaying game, you have the choice of your species, your background, your career path, and your psych profile. Blueshift uses the modular Librium system that allows you to customize your specialization, picking your talents as you see fit with no classes that restrict your choices. Blueshift is designed as an immersive role-playing experience that combines storytelling, intrigue, exploration, and tactical combat.
